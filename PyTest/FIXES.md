# Bugs:

1. 'divide_numbers' Has no exception for dividing by zero
2. 'reverse_strings' Does not check for non-string inputs
3. 'get_list_element' Does not properly check for Boundary exceptions
4. 'get_list_element' Does should return an exception for boundary violations


# Solutions:

1. Dividing by zero results in 'Undefined'
2. Checks if input is string before going forward
3. Fixed boundary check
4. Returns an exception for boundary violations
